However, all Bayesian inference tasks are equally well suited for TreePPL.  The Tree in TreePPL can be understood both to mean a phylogenetic tree or the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a high level language. Its syntax is heavily influenced by WebPPL.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Glossary/functional":{"id":"Glossary/functional","title":"Functional programming languages","description":"Functional programming languages focus on expressing computation as function transformations rather than as instructions.
