The ultimate vision is to provide expressive, Turing-complete model description languages, while at the same time supporting the automated generation of efficient inference algorithms from these model descriptions. This would allow empiricists to easily and succinctly describe any model they might be interested in, relying on the automated machinery to provide efficient inference algorithms for that model.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
