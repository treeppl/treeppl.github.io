# TreePPL Documentation

The TreePPL documentation consists of:

 - [Model examples](docs/examples), which illustrate each model available in TreePPL;
 - [Reference](docs/reference), which is material that contains the technical details of functions, compiler flags, options, etc.
 - [Tutorials](docs/tutorials), in which the user learns by doing something meaningful, towards some achievable goal;
<!-- - To be added: System, which is documentation for the people who would like to develop the TreePPL language itself -->

If you are new to TreePPL, we recommend beginning looking at our [Getting started pages](getting-started/getting-started).
