# TreePPL documentation

If you are new to universal probabilistic programming and TreePPL, we recommend beginning by going through our [introductory tutorial](./tutorials/treeppl-intro.md).

The TreePPL documentation consists of:

 - [Installing TreePPL](./installing.md), with instructions on how to install TreePPL,
 - [Python interface](./python-interface.md), documenting the Python interface,
 - [Jupyter interface](./jupyter-interface.md), describing how to work with TreePPL in Jupyter notebooks,
 - [R interface](./r-interface.md), documenting the R interface,
 - [Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md), in which the user learns by doing something meaningful, towards some achievable goal,
 - [Language overview](./language-overview.md), which contains a basic language description,
 - [Distributions](./distributions.md), describing available distributions and related information,
 - [Inference methods](./inference.md), describing available inference techniques,
 - [Model library](./model-library/index.md), which contains model examples that can be used as templates,
 - [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md), describing solutions to problems you may encounter when installing or running TreePPL,
 - [Contribute to TreePPL development](./for-developers/index.md), with instructions for installing the command-line version and for contributing to the TreePPL development effort,
 - [How to cite](./how_to_cite.md), with information on how to cite TreePPL.
