# Mac (Apple silicon) Installation Guide

:::warning

There are currently issues with installing some of TreePPL's dependencies on recent Macs (Apple Silicon). We are working on it, but for now we recommend using the Linux or WSL versions instead, if possible.

:::

### 1. Check Command Line Tools

Before proceeding, ensure that your Command Line Tools are up-to-date. Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
This will prompt you to install or update the necessary development tools.

### 2. Install Dependencies via Homebrew
To install the required dependencies, use Homebrew. If Homebrew is not installed, you can install it by running:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
After installing Homebrew, use the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
brew install python@3.11  # This installs Python 3.11 and pip3
brew install make gcc openblas
```

#### Set GCC as the Default cc Compiler
If GCC is not set as your default cc compiler, create a symlink to ensure it's used:

```bash
# Create a symbolic link to use GCC as the default cc compiler
# Note: Adjust the GCC version if different (e.g., gcc-12)
cd $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin && ln -s gcc-12 cc
```

Verify: After this, check that cc points to the correct compiler:
```bash
which cc
```
Open a new terminal window if necessary for the changes to take effect.

###  3. Set Up Environment for Compilation
Now, set the required environment variables for the compilation process:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
export OWL_CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math -DSFMT_MEXP=19937 -fno-strict-aliasing -Wno-tautological-constant-out-of-range-compare"
export OWL_AEOS_CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math -DSFMT_MEXP=19937 -fno-strict-aliasing"
export EIGENCPP_OPTFLAGS="-Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math"
export EIGEN_FLAGS="-O3 -Ofast -funroll-loops -ffast-math"
```

If you want, you can now remove the `cc` symlink created earlier.

### 4. Install Dependencies via Opam
You need to install Opam, the OCaml package manager. If Opam is not installed, follow the installation instructions here:
[Opam Installation Guide](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)

Once `opam` is installed, create a switch for OCaml 5.0.0:

```bash
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0
eval $(opam env)
```

Next, install the required OCaml packages:

```bash
opam install pyml toml lwt owl ocamlformat.0.24.1 dune linenoise
```


### 5. Install Miking and TreePPL
The following script installs **Miking** and **TreePPL** compilers along with the required packages:

```bash
# Initialize environment
eval $(opam env)

# Clone and install Miking
git clone -n https://github.com/treeppl/miking.git
cd miking
git checkout 24505bd
make install

# Go back to the original directory
cd ..

# Clone and install Miking-DPPL
git clone -n https://github.com/treeppl/miking-dppl.git
cd miking-dppl
git checkout 680ea76
make install

# Go back to the original directory
cd ..

# Clone and install TreePPL
git clone https://github.com/treeppl/treeppl.git
cd treeppl
make install

# Go back to the original directory
cd ..

# Clone and install TreePPL-Python
git clone https://github.com/treeppl/treeppl-python.git
cd treeppl-python
pip install -e .
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

This script will create four directories (`miking`, `miking-dppl`, `treeppl` and `treeppl-python`) where you execute the script and instruct you how to set up the environment variables. If you donâ€™t plan to work on TreePPL development, you can safely remove the `miking` and `miking-dppl` directories after the installation:

```bash
rm -rf miking/ miking-dppl/
```

### 6. Customize Your Environment
To ensure your environment is set up correctly every time you open a terminal, add the necessary environment variables to your `~/.zshrc` file:

Edit your `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```
Then, add the following lines at the end of the file:
```bash
## Customizations for TreePPL
eval $(opam env)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
export MCORE_LIBS="coreppl=$HOME/.local/src/coreppl/"
export MCORE_LIBS="$MCORE_LIBS:treeppl=$HOME/.local/src/treeppl/"
```
Save and close the file (in `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `ENTER`).

To apply the changes, either close and reopen the terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 7. Test Your Installation

To verify that the installation worked correctly, restart your terminal session and run:
```bash
tpplc
```

You should see the manual page for the tpplc compiler.

To further verify the setup, you can run the example `coin.py` located in the `treeppl-python` directory:

```bash
cd treeppl-python/examples
python3 coin.py
```

If you are using a graphical terminal, a plot showing the inferred coin distribution should appear. If not, you can open the generated image file `coin_outcomes_plot.png`:
```bash
open coin_outcomes_plot.png
```
Once you have verified the output, you can delete the image:
```bash
rm coin_outcomes_plot.png
```
