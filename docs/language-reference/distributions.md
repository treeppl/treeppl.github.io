# Distributions

## Available distributions

| Distribution | Usage and parameters |
|----------|----------|
| Bernoulli | `Bernoulli(prob);` where `prob` is a Real |  
| Beta | `Beta(a, b);` where `a` and `b` are Reals |  
| Binomial | `Binomial(n, prob);`  where `n` is an Integer and `prob` is a Real|
| Categorical | `Categorical(probs);` where `probs` is a sequence of Reals|  
| Dirichlet | `Dirichlet(alphas);` where `alphas` is a sequence of Reals|  
| Exponential | `Exponential(rate);` where `rate` is a Real|
| Gamma | `Gamma(shape, scale);` where `shape` and `scale` are Reals|
| Gaussian | `Gaussian(mean, stdev);` where `mean` and `stdev` are Reals|
| Multinomial | `Multinomial(n, probs);` where `n` is an Integer and `probs` is a sequence of Reals|
